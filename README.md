I'm a former intern at EscalaXZ and a Computer Science student at the University of Brasilia.<br/>
During my internship at EscalaXZ and WeDoCare (two partner companies working in the same establishment under supervision of Felipe Yani and Renato Dias, for clients like CÃ¡tia Damasceno) I learned and applied aspects of programming and marketing. Facebook Ads, Make (former Integromat), Manychat, N8N, AWS, Metabase dashboards... I used several tools for the purpose of reducing time spent doing repetitive tasks, increasing the number of leads and sales, and gathering valuable information so that we can better direct our money investments on more profitable ad campaigns.<br/>
My programming career started when I took the Python Course from Hashtag Treinamentos, where I learned several things from basic to advanced Python programming, including APIs and JSON, SQL, and data analysis with Pandas.<br/>
At my university, I learned perseverance with coding marathons like IEEExtreme 17.0, a 24-hour marathon, where I solved coding problems with C++ and Python languages. I also participated in other university marathons in a team with two other colleagues.
I've honed my skills in cloud computing, specifically on Amazon AWS, by automating data extraction from APIs with Lambda, managing ETL processes with AWS Glue, maintaining databases on Amazon RDS with Postgres, and connecting such databases to interactive dashboards in Metabase, Power BI and Looker Studio.<br/>
If you want to see my projects, feel free to check out [my repositories](https://github.com/joviprata?tab=repositories). They cover several topics, including:<br/>
- Process Automations
- Flask (website creation)
- Data Analysis with Pandas
- Python Integrations with:
  - SQL
  - Web Automations (Web-Scraping with Selenium)
  - Files and computer folders
  - E-mail
  - APIs and JSON
- Games
- Tkinter (Graphical User Interface)
- Turning Python code into an executable file
- Auto-run codes periodically, even with the PC turned off
